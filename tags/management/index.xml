Some companies have so called &amp;ldquo;head of talent&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;talent acquisition&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;talent development&amp;rdquo; professionals on their payroll - basically a re-branding of HR. With the amount of conversations, conference talks and hype going on around talent, you would expect people will have an answer to the question &amp;ldquo;what is talent?</description></item><item><title>If all you have is MS Project, everything looks like a time estimate</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/if-all-you-have-is-ms-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 10:24:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/if-all-you-have-is-ms-project/</guid><description>One of the things that struck me the most when observing managers at work, and in particular newly instated managers, is how managers become more and more out of touch with the realities of work. There&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot of research on that from quite a bit of different perspectives. Safety research for example has interesting things to say about &amp;ldquo;work as imagined&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;work as done&amp;rdquo;. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen over night of course, but rather a slow process - and I found it has a lot to do with the shift from doing and experiencing to planning and monitoring.</description></item><item><title>Plans are valuable, but planning is invaluable</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/plans-are-valuable-planning-is-invaluable/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 05:05:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/plans-are-valuable-planning-is-invaluable/</guid><description>In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable. Dwight D. Eisenhower What would you give for the ability to predict the future? a lot I presume. Knowing the future (and being free to act on it) can make you rich, successful, almost indestructible. What would you give to know the future with 90% probability of being right? well, if you can participate in the lottery every week 90% pretty much guarantees success, definitely valuable.</description></item><item><title>No, engineers don't suck at time estimates</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/no-engineers-dont-suck-at-estimates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 21:14:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/no-engineers-dont-suck-at-estimates/</guid><description>No, engineers don&amp;rsquo;t suck at time estimates - and generally speaking humans are better estimators than what most people believe. This seems rather surprising given all we&amp;rsquo;ve heard about the problems of bad time estimations, projects going overboard, etc and of course, your personal experience with software time estimates. But if people are really bad at estimation, how does that fit with our obvious evolutionary need to make quick decisions based on partial data?</description></item><item><title>The Burndown Chart Fallacy</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:34:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/</guid><description>Have you ever walked into an office and saw a huge flat screen on the wall displaying a dashboard with pretty graphs, or some other nice visualization showing some important looking numbers? Back when people still frequented offices, many had them. But have you ever wondered, what are they for? No engineer is looking at them, because when you are looking at data you want to interact with the data, zoom, pan or apply some filter.</description></item><item><title>How to Measure Anything</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/how-to-measure-anything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 09:48:38 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/how-to-measure-anything/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/turn-the-ship-around/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2016 08:37:57 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/turn-the-ship-around/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/the-phoenix-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:12:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/the-phoenix-project/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays On Software Engineering</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/the-mythical-man-month/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:10:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/the-mythical-man-month/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/peopleware/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:03:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/peopleware/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/the-goal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:01:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/the-goal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How many startup engineers does it take to change a lightbulb?</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/how-many-engineers-does-it-take-to-change-a-lightbulb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 19:40:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/how-many-engineers-does-it-take-to-change-a-lightbulb/</guid><description>2 - a technical co-founder and a business co-founder. Since they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money for proper lightbulb they use an old socket and lightbulb they found in the garage and since they don&amp;rsquo;t fit the technical co-founder builds a makeshift adapter from duct tape and aluminum foil. This actually works as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t tilt it too much. During seed negotiations the co-founders break up and the technical co-founder leaves.</description></item></channel></rss>
