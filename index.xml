Some companies have so called &amp;ldquo;head of talent&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;talent acquisition&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;talent development&amp;rdquo; professionals on their payroll - basically a re-branding of HR.

There&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot of research on that from quite a bit of different perspectives. Safety research for example has interesting things to say about &amp;ldquo;work as imagined&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;work as done&amp;rdquo;. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen over night of course, but rather a slow process - and I found it has a lot to do with the shift from doing and experiencing to planning and monitoring.</description></item><item><title>Plans are valuable, but planning is invaluable</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/plans-are-valuable-planning-is-invaluable/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 05:05:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/plans-are-valuable-planning-is-invaluable/</guid><description>In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.

This seems rather surprising given all we&amp;rsquo;ve heard about the problems of bad time estimations, projects going overboard, etc and of course, your personal experience with software time estimates. But if people are really bad at estimation, how does that fit with our obvious evolutionary need to make quick decisions based on partial data?</description></item><item><title>The Burndown Chart Fallacy</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:34:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/</guid><description>Have you ever walked into an office and saw a huge flat screen on the wall displaying a dashboard with pretty graphs, or some other nice visualization showing some important looking numbers?

No engineer is looking at them, because when you are looking at data you want to interact with the data, zoom, pan or apply some filter.</description></item><item><title>How to Measure Anything</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/how-to-measure-anything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 09:48:38 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/how-to-measure-anything/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Design of Design</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/design-of-design/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 09:43:38 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/book/design-of-design/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A little about me</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/page/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 12:10:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/page/about/</guid><description>In a world where anything has an API, everything is a software problem nukemberg My name is Avishai Ish-Shalom, AKA @nukemberg on Twitter.

Practical questions I imagine have crossed the minds of many VP R&amp;amp;Ds and CTOs.

Initially, I was taken by the arguments: If someone is travelling from afar to speak, their costs should be reimburst.</description></item><item><title>The Future of O/S</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/presentation/the-future-of-os/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2016 09:18:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/presentation/the-future-of-os/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Finding a needle in a haystack -

It turns out there’s no point refuting those arguments, because, and I cannot emphasize this enough:&lt;/p>

Failures promote reliability When a system is reliable long enough, production pressure causes the operators to drive the system harder; Over time operators become less careful as the trauma of the last failure wears off. More workload is applied, new features introduced, etc, until the system trails again into the danger zone (e.g. high load once thought to be dangerous), sailing through smoothly this time, thus boosting the confidence of operators in the robustness of their system.</description></item><item><title>Bash is a thought pattern</title><link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/bash-is-a-thought-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 00:38:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/bash-is-a-thought-pattern/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
