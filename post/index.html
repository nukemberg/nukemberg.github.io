There&rsquo;s actually a lot of research on that from quite a bit of different perspectives. Safety research for example has interesting things to say about &ldquo;work as imagined&rdquo; and &ldquo;work as done&rdquo;. This doesn&rsquo;t happen over night of course, but rather a slow process - and I found it has a lot to do with the shift from doing and experiencing to planning and monitoring.<footer><a href=https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/if-all-you-have-is-ms-project/ class=post-read-more><i class="bi bi-book"></i></a></footer></div><div><a class="btn btn-light" href=/tags/software-engineering>software-engineering</a>
